# MAIS-202-Coding-Challenge
This is my submission to the MAIS 202 Coding Challenge for the Winter 2019 Term

My python script is data.py and is coded in python 2.7
It can be run in a Terminal. eg: $ python2.7 data.py
It runs on the data.csv and creates the result.xlsx where the graph is created and stored.
I have added the result.xlsx just as an example of what my code produces but is run again, my script will overwrite the resulst.xlsx file with a new one.

Thank you
